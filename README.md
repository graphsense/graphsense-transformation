# GraphSense Transformation Pipeline (Moved to graphsense-spark)

CAUTION: Code is now maintained in repository [Graphsense Spark][graphsense-spark]

The GraphSense Transformation Pipeline reads raw block data, which is
ingested into [Apache Cassandra][apache-cassandra]
by the [graphsense-blocksci][graphsense-blocksci] /
[graphsense-bitcoin-etl][graphsense-bitcoin-etl] component.
The transformation pipeline computes de-normalized views using
[Apache Spark][apache-spark], which are again stored in Cassandra.

Access to computed de-normalized views is subsequently provided by the
[GraphSense REST][graphsense-rest] interface, which is used by the
[graphsense-dashboard][graphsense-dashboard] component.

This component is implemented in [Scala][scala-lang] using
[Apache Spark][apache-spark].

## Local Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure [Java 8][java] and [sbt >= 1.0][scala-sbt] is installed:

    java -version
    sbt about

Download, install, and run [Apache Spark][apache-spark] (version 3.2.1)
in `$SPARK_HOME`:

    $SPARK_HOME/sbin/start-master.sh

Download, install, and run [Apache Cassandra][apache-cassandra]
(version >= 3.11) in `$CASSANDRA_HOME`

    $CASSANDRA_HOME/bin/cassandra -f

### Ingest Raw Block Data

Run the following script for ingesting raw block test data

    ./scripts/ingest_test_data.sh

This should create a keyspace `btc_raw` (tables `exchange_rates`,
`transaction`, `block`, `block_transactions`). Check as follows

    cqlsh localhost
    cqlsh> USE btc_raw;
    cqlsh:btc_raw> DESCRIBE tables;

## Execute Transformation Locally

Create the target keyspace for transformed data

    cqlsh -f scripts/schema_transformed.cql

Compile and test the implementation

    sbt test

Package the transformation pipeline

    sbt package

Run the transformation pipeline on localhost

    ./submit.sh

macOS only: make sure `gnu-getopt` is installed (`brew install gnu-getopt`).

Check the running job using the local Spark UI at http://localhost:4040/jobs

# Submit on a standalone Spark Cluster

Use the `submit.sh` script and specify the Spark master node
(e.g., `-s spark://SPARK_MASTER_IP:7077`) and other options:

```
./submit.sh -h
Usage: submit.sh [-h] [-m MEMORY_GB] [-c CASSANDRA_HOST] [-s SPARK_MASTER]
                 [--currency CURRENCY]
                 [--raw_keyspace RAW_KEYSPACE]
                 [--tgt_keyspace TGT_KEYSPACE]
                 [--bucket_size BUCKET_SIZE]
                 [--bech32-prefix BECH32_PREFIX]
                 [--checkpoint-dir CHECKPOINT_DIR]
                 [--coinjoin-filtering]
```
